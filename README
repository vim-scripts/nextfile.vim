How it works

When initialized, set related files
In vim window, when n is pressed

1. Get the current file name
2. Get the related files
3. Open a window with related files and let you to choose which file to open
   1) <Enter> to open in a current window
   2) "o" to open in a horizontally splitted window
   3) "v" to open in a vertically split window

For Rails developers, there is pre-defined mapping like the following. You may want to change this. If so, you can re-define this in your .vimrc
    let g:nextFilesMap["Ruby On Rails"] = {
      \ "Ruby On Rails" : {
        \ "Controller" : { "expression" : "app/controllers/(.*)_controller.rb$", "transform" : "pluralize" },
        \ "Funtional Test" : { "expression" : "test/functional/(.*)_controller_test.rb$", "transform" : "pluralize" },
        \ "View" : { "expression" : "app/views/(.*)/", "transform" : "pluralize" },
        \ "Model" : { "expression" : "app/models/(.*).rb$", "transform" : "singularize" },
        \ "Unit Test" : { "expression" : "test/unit/(.*)_test.rb$", "transform" : "singularize" }
      \ }
    \ }
